# Introduction to Fastly's CDN :taco:

This is the example static website for the [*Introduction to Fastly's CDN*](https://www.fastly.com/documentation/solutions/tutorials/introduction-to-cdn/) tutorial. 

## How to use this

You can fork or clone the repository, check out the `fastly-cdn` branch, and use the [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com) to build the site from scratch.

Alternatively, if you'd prefer not to install Jekyll and the dependencies, you can access the fully built website in the `_built` directory. You could manually upload the HTML files and assets in that directory to an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Running locally

It can be helpful to preview changes on your computer. After forking or cloning this repository and checking out the `fastly-cdn` branch, perform the following steps to generate the site and preview it:

- Make sure you have ruby installed on your computer. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Building locally

If you want to build the site locally (output to HTML), follow the instructions above to install ruby and the gems, then run `bundle exec jekyll build`. The site will be built and saved in the `_site` directory.

## AWS S3 configuration

If you decide to host your site in an AWS S3 bucket, you should make the bucket public and enable the S3 static website hosting feature. You may also need to add a bucket policy similar to the one we're using:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddPerm",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::www.tacolabs.com/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
